This Script was created to save me time when setting up a Kali Box for the first time.
This script does the following:
	* apt update
	* Fixes the gpg key error
	* Fixes the rolling repo update error
	* Fixes the issue armitage has by setting the system to run msfdb init after every reboot
	* Installs openstego based on OS bit version (32 vs 64)
